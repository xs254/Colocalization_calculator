# Colocalization_Analyzer
This is a Matlab app designed to analyze percentage of antigen/membrane colocalization used in [Xiaoyu et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01571-5).
Please read the [user manual](<User manual for colocalization calculator.docx>) for detailed instructions on how to use this app . 
The only difference between the Mac and Win version is the function used for the 'Opne Folder' button. In MAC version, winopen() is replaced by system().
